VFX, SFX:
    Bullet hit node FX (steal mostly from 3dguns)
    Bullet fly-by SFX
    HUD system (most can once again be pulled from 3dguns)
        reload progress
        ammunition left
        ammo type
    gun animations (take 3dguns as an example, then completely rewrite)
        +player model & gun model reading
    gun sounds

gun features
    firemodes
    gun ammo:
        ~magazine relaoding
        fractional reloading
        magless flat reload
    *!!fix gimbal lock (ironsights broken)*
    "3d" optics
    attachments (last before beta)
    fix shooting through walls be pressing against them
    correct player look-down
    gun leaning
    cap aimed look angles <80 - >-80 (gun bugs out)
    add hip and aim bone offsets (this is for guns or modifiers that add stuff like "laser sights" or hud that simulates holographic sights, could be cool for futuristic type shooters)
    movement rotation
bullets
    bullet class system
        add blunt force properties
        on_hitnode function callback

optimization
    !!hardcore optimization of get_dir() type functions required- super inefficient.

auxillary (beta+/never)
    player hitboxes

    server to client lag prediction
    possible user CSM for lag prediction
    bullet drop (maybe bullet wind?)
    bullet tracers
    inverse kinematics
    stamina
    a better system for reloading magazine (something like a inventory that fractionally reloads magazines so it takes time.)
    create a non-player gun API
