(~) add audio
    (x) sfx system
        (x) did signifficant work on it
    (x) firing sound effects
    ( ) reload sound effects
    ( ) firemode sound effects
(~) add config
    (x) add a table for config storage, some settings
    ( ) integrate with minetest settings
(x) fix crash when switching from a gun into a gun with a sprite_scope
(x) add infinite ammo privelage and quick command
    (x) privilege not directly tied to infinite ammo, fix without breaking performance?
(x) fix animation rotation offset not displaying the correct frame
    -was a problem with MTUL, changes push :D
( ) add entity scopes (for holo sights etc)
( ) add attachments
( ) add other reloading types
    (x) magazine
    ( ) fractional
    ( ) flat (magless)
    ( ) fractional clip
( ) (for 5.9) make infinite ammo priv to rely on on_grant and on_revoke callback for runtime changes (cannot be done as broken in 5.8)
( ) (5.9) POTENTIALLY make models use new PR that allows bone offsets to be disabled
    -I'd probably have to modify models at loadtime to have an eye and hipfire bone? Probably easier then current system though.
( ) Fix HORRIBLE namespace violation in misc_helpers.lua. Also migrate features to MTUL libraries

this won't be fun.
